Cleave is a lightweight, GPU-accelerated screen capture tool that allows users to quickly select and copy portions of their screen. Built with Rust and WGPU, it offers smooth performance and minimal resource usage.

## Showcase

## Key Features

- üöÄ GPU-accelerated rendering using WGPU
- üéØ Interactive screen region selection
- ‚å®Ô∏è Keyboard-driven controls for precise adjustments
- üìã Direct-to-clipboard copying
- üñºÔ∏è Support for high DPI displays
- üé® Real-time visual feedback during selection

## Quick Start

1. Launch Cleave
2. Click and drag to select a screen region
3. Press `Space` to copy the selection to clipboard
4. Press `Esc` to cancel and exit

## Installation

### From Source

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/exotik850/cleave.git
cd cleave

# Build and install
cargo install --path .
```
### Linux System Requirements

On Linux, you need to install `libxcb`, `libxrandr`, and `dbus`.

##### Debian/Ubuntu:

```
apt-get install libxcb1 libxrandr2 libdbus-1-3
```

##### Alpine:

```
apk add libxcb libxrandr dbus
```

##### ArchLinux:

```
pacman -S libxcb libxrandr dbus
```

## Usage

### Keyboard Controls

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `Space` | Copy selection and exit |
| `Esc` | Cancel and exit |
| `Arrow Keys` | Fine-tune selection |
| `Shift + Arrow Keys` | Adjust selection start point |
| `Ctrl + Arrow Keys` | Move entire selection |
| `Right Click` | Cancel current selection |

### Selection Modes

Cleave offers three selection modes:

1. **Resize Mode** (Default)
   - Use arrow keys to adjust selection size
   
2. **Move Mode** (Hold Ctrl)
   - Move entire selection without changing its size
   
3. **Inverse Resize Mode** (Hold Shift)
   - Adjust selection from the starting point

## Configuration

Cleave uses sensible defaults and currently doesn't require configuration. Future versions may introduce a configuration file for customization.
